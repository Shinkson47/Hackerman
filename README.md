# Hackerman

A super basic NT parser for pushing commands to the Windows interpreter command; 

intended for systems where the NT command interpreter has been disabled by system administrators. Often, batch file can still run on these systems, and this
works around it.

Made this to use the command line on collage computers, can you tell?
